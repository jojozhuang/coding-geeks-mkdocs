# Concurrency overview

## How to Create a Java Thread?

Java lets you create thread in following two ways:

* By implementing the `Runnable` interface.
* By extending the `Thread`

### Runnable Interface

```java
public interface Runnable {
    void run();
}
```

Create a class to implement the interface.

```java
public class MyClass implements Runnable {
    public void run(){
        System.out.println("MyClass running");
    }
}
```

Create thread and run it.

```java
Thread t1 = new Thread(new MyClass ());
t1.start();
```

### Thread Class

Create a class to extend the Thread class.

```java
public class MyClass extends Thread {
    public void run(){
        System.out.println("MyClass running");
    }
}
```

Create thread and run it.

```java
MyClass t2 = new MyClass();
t2.start();
```

### Thread States

* `New` - When a new thread is created, it is in the new state. (new Thread();)
* `Runnable` - A thread that is ready to run is moved to runnable state. (t1.run();)
* `Blocked` - When a thread is temporarily inactive, e.g. (require a lock)
* `Waiting` - When a thread is temporarily inactive, e.g. (wait on a condition);
* `Timed Waiting` - A thread lies in timed waiting state when it calls a method with a time out parameter. (Thread.sleep(1000);)
* `Terminated` -  A thread terminates because of either of the following reasons: Normally exits or interrupted.

## Synchronization

Monitor, lock, race condition.Reentrant Lock, Intrinsic Lock

## Thread Pool

## Synchronizers

The java.util.concurrent package contains several classes that help manage a set of collaborating threads. These mechanisms have “canned functionality” for common rendezvous patterns between threads. If you have a set of collaborating threads that follow one of these behavior patterns, you should simply reuse the appropriate library class instead of trying to come up with a handcrafted collection of locks and conditions.

Class              | What It Does | Notes
-------------------|--------------|-----------------------------------------------
`CyclicBarrier`    | Allows a set of threads to wait until a predefined count of them has reached a common barrier, and then optionally executes a barrier action.  | Use when a number of threads need to complete before their results can be used. The barrier can be reused after the waiting threads have been released.
`Phaser`           | Like a cyclic barrier, but with a mutable party count.  | Introduced in Java SE 7.
`CountDownLatch`   | Allows a set of threads to wait until a count has been decremented to 0.  | Use when one or more threads need to wait until a specified number of events have occurred.
`Exchanger`        | Allows two threads to exchange objects when both are ready for the exchange.  | Use when two threads work on two instances of the same data structure, with the first thread filling one instance and the second thread emptying the other.
`Semaphore`        | Allows a set of threads to wait until permits are available for proceeding.  | Use to restrict the total number of threads that can access a resource. If the permit count is one, use to block threads until another thread gives permission.
`SynchronousQueue` | Allows a thread to hand off an object to another thread. | Use to send an object from one thread to another when both are ready, without explicit synchronization.
