# BlockingQueue

BlockingQueue interface and its implementations.

## BlockingQueue Interface

BlockingQueue Interface(java.util.concurrent.BlockingQueue) is a Queue that additionally supports operations that wait for the queue to become non-empty when retrieving an element, and wait for space to become available in the queue when storing an element.

### Operations on BlockingQueue

BlockingQueue methods come in four forms, with different ways of handling operations that cannot be satisfied immediately, but may be satisfied at some point in the future: one throws an exception, the second returns a special value (either null or false, depending on the operation), the third blocks the current thread indefinitely until the operation can succeed, and the fourth blocks for only a given maximum time limit before giving up. These methods are summarized in the following table:

Operation | Throws exception | Special value | Blocks        | Times out
----------|------------------|---------------|---------------|----------------------
Insert    | add(e)           | offer(e)      | put(e)        | offer(e, time, unit)
Remove    | remove()         | poll()        | take()        | poll(time, unit)
Examine   | element()        | peek()        | not applicable| not applicable

* BlockingQueue does not accept null elements. Implementations throw NullPointerException on attempts to add, put or offer a null.

### BlockingQueue Types

* `Unbounded Queue`: The Capacity of blocking queue will be set to Integer.MAX_VALUE. Unbounded queue will never block because it could grow to a very large size. When you add elements, itâ€™s size grows.

```java
BlockingQueue blockingQueue = new LinkedBlockingDeque();
```

* `Bounded Queue`: The capacity of bounded queue is fixed. You can create a bounded queue by passing the capacity of queue in constructor.

```java
// Creates a Blocking Queue with capacity 5
BlockingQueue blockingQueue = new LinkedBlockingDeque(5);
```

### Classes implements BlockingQueue Interface

* ArrayBlockingQueue
* LinkedBlockingQueue
* PriorityBlockingQueue
* SynchronousQueue
* LinkedBlockingDeque

### ArrayBlockingQueue vs. LinkedBlockingQueue

* ArrayBlockingQueue is always bounded.
* LinkedBlockingQueue can be unbounded.
* ArrayBlockingQueue can be created with a configurable (on/off) scheduling fairness policy. This is great if you need fairness or want to avoid producer/consumer starvation, but it will cost you in throughput.
* ArrayBlockingQueue pre-allocates its backing array, so it doesn't allocate nodes during its usage, but it immediately takes what can be a considerable chunk of memory, which can be a problem if your memory is fragmented.
* ArrayBlockingQueue should have less variability in performance, because it has less moving parts overall, it uses a simpler and less-sophisticated single-lock algorithm, it does not create nodes during usage, and its cache behavior should be fairly consistent.
* LinkedBlockingQueue should have `better throughput`, because it uses separate locks for the head and the tail.
* LinkedBlockingQueue does not pre-allocate nodes, which means that its memory footprint will roughly match its size, but it also means that it will incur some work for allocation and freeing of nodes.
* LinkedBlockingQueue will probably have `worse cache behavior`, which may affect its own performance, but also the performance of other components due to false sharing.

## BlockingQueue Example

### Message

The object will be created by producer and consumed by consumer.

```java
public class Message {
    private String msg;

    public Message(String msg){
        this.msg = msg;
    }

    public String getMessage() {
        return msg;
    }
}
```

### Producer

Producer creates messages and put them into the queue.

```java
import java.util.concurrent.BlockingQueue;

public class Producer implements Runnable {

    private BlockingQueue<Message> bq;

    public Producer(BlockingQueue<Message> bq){
        this.bq = bq;
    }

    @Override
    public void run() {
        //produce messages
        for (int i = 0; i < 20; i++){
            Message msg = new Message("Message-" + i);
            try {
                Thread.sleep(i);
                bq.put(msg);
                System.out.println("Produced " + msg.getMessage());
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }
        //adding exit message
        Message msg = new Message("exit");
        try {
            bq.put(msg);
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

### Consumer

Consumer will process on the messages from the queue and terminates when exit message is received.

```java
import java.util.concurrent.BlockingQueue;

public class Consumer implements Runnable{

    private BlockingQueue<Message> bq;

    public Consumer(BlockingQueue<Message> bq){
        this.bq = bq;
    }

    @Override
    public void run() {
        try {
            Message msg;
            //consuming messages until exit message is received
            while ((!(msg = bq.take()).getMessage().equals("exit"))) {
                Thread.sleep(100);
                System.out.println("Consumed " + msg.getMessage());
            }
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

### Test Class

This test class will create the BlockingQueue with fixed size and share with both producers and consumers. It will start producer and consumer threads and exit.

```java
public class BlockingQueueExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        //Creating BlockingQueue of size 10
        BlockingQueue<Message> queue = new ArrayBlockingQueue<>(5);

        Producer producer = new Producer(queue);
        Consumer consumer = new Consumer(queue);

        //starting producer to produce messages in queue
        new Thread(producer).start();

        //starting consumer to consume messages from queue
        new Thread(consumer).start();

        System.out.println("Producer and Consumer has been started");
    }
}
```

Output.

```raw

Produced Message-0
Produced Message-1

Produced Message-3
Produced Message-4
